> hello

✦ Hello! I'm ready for your first command.

> can you told me somthing about human behavior

✦ Human behavior is the complex way people interact with the world and each other. It's a mix of actions and inactions, influenced by a
  huge range of factors. Here's a breakdown of some key aspects:

  What drives our behavior?

   * Biology and Genetics: Our genes can predispose us to certain traits and behaviors.
   * Psychology: Our thoughts, feelings, and personality play a massive role.
   * Social and Cultural Influences: The society we live in, our family, friends, and cultural norms all shape our actions.
   * Environment: Our physical surroundings and life experiences mold us.

  Different Lenses to Understand Behavior:

  There are many theories that try to explain why we do what we do. Some of the major ones include:

   * Behaviorism: This view suggests that our behavior is learned through rewards and punishments.
   * Cognitive Theory: This focuses on how our thoughts, beliefs, and expectations drive our actions.
   * Psychoanalytic Theory: Sigmund Freud's famous theory emphasizes the influence of the unconscious mind on our behavior.
   * Humanistic Theory: This perspective highlights our free will and the desire for personal growth as key motivators.

  In short, human behavior is a rich and complex field of study. It's the result of a constant interplay between our internal world
  and the external world around us.

> based on your knowladge, what some think that all human are same in behavior

✦ That's a fascinating question that gets to the heart of the "nature vs. nurture" debate. While surface-level behaviors vary
  dramatically across cultures and individuals, there are several fundamental aspects of human behavior that are considered universal,
  which might lead someone to believe all humans are essentially the same.

  Here are some of the core similarities:

  1. Biological and Survival Instincts
  At the most basic level, all humans share the same biological drives for survival and reproduction.
   * Self-Preservation: The "fight or flight" response to danger is universal. Everyone has an instinct to avoid pain, find food and
     water, and seek shelter.
   * Desire for Offspring: The drive to reproduce and ensure the survival of one's genes is a fundamental motivator across all
     societies.
   * Need for Sleep: Every human requires sleep to function, and patterns of fatigue and rest are a shared experience.

  2. Core Emotions and Expressions
  Psychologist Paul Ekman's research showed that there are several basic emotions that are universally recognized and expressed through
   the same facial expressions, regardless of culture.
   * The Universal Emotions: Joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust. A smile is recognized as a sign of happiness everywhere
     in the world.

  3. Social and Group Behavior
  Humans are inherently social creatures. The way we form groups and interact within them follows similar patterns.
   * The Need to Belong: The desire for social connection—to be part of a family, a group of friends, or a community—is a powerful and
     universal human motivation. Ostracism or loneliness is painful in every culture.
   * In-Group/Out-Group Mentality: Humans everywhere tend to categorize people into "us" and "them." We naturally favor our own group
     and can be wary of outsiders.
   * Reciprocity: The principle of "you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours" is a fundamental building block of cooperation in all
     human societies.

  4. Cognitive Foundations
  The basic architecture of the human brain is the same, leading to similar ways of thinking and learning.
   * Language Acquisition: While thousands of languages exist, the innate ability of a human infant to learn a complex language is a
     universal trait.
   * Cognitive Biases: Mental shortcuts, like confirmation bias (favoring information that confirms our existing beliefs), are common
     to all humans.
   * Causality: We all have a tendency to look for cause-and-effect relationships to make sense of the world around us.

  So, while the expression of our behavior is shaped by our culture, upbringing, and personal experiences, the underlying blueprint is
   remarkably consistent. Someone might observe these universal drives, emotions, and social patterns and conclude that, deep down,
  all humans operate on the same fundamental "software."

> why humans have lust? why they have ego? why they want somthing from other but never mind what they do to another humans?

✦ These are profound questions that touch upon the very core of the human condition. Philosophers, scientists, and spiritual leaders
  have wrestled with them for millennia. Here’s a breakdown from a combined evolutionary, psychological, and social perspective.

  1. Why Humans Have Lust

  Lust is one of the most powerful and primal human drives, and its origin is fundamentally biological and evolutionary.

   * The Engine of Procreation: At its core, lust is the raw, instinctual drive to reproduce. From an evolutionary standpoint, any
     species that doesn't have a strong mechanism to ensure it procreates will simply cease to exist. Our ancestors who felt a powerful
     urge to mate were the ones who passed on their genes. Lust is the feature, not the bug, that ensured the survival of our species.
   * The Brain's Reward System: Lust is deeply tied to the pleasure and reward centers of our brain. Sex releases a cocktail of powerful
     neurochemicals like dopamine (associated with desire and reward) and oxytocin (associated with bonding). This makes the act feel
     good, reinforcing the behavior and making us want to do it again. It's nature's way of making sure the vital task of reproduction is
      something we actively seek out.

  While it starts as a biological drive, it becomes much more complex in humans, getting entangled with emotion, love, and social
  structures. But at its root, it is the non-negotiable, evolutionary command to continue the species.

  2. Why Humans Have an Ego

  The "ego" is our sense of self, our "I." It's the conscious part of our mind that experiences the world, makes decisions, and
  creates our identity. Like lust, it is essential, but it can also cause immense problems.

   * A Tool for Navigation: The ego is a psychological tool for survival. It helps us differentiate ourselves from others ("this is me,
     that is you"). It allows us to plan for the future based on past experiences, to understand our place in a social group, and to
     pursue goals that benefit us. Without an ego, we would be unable to function as coherent individuals.
   * The Protector of the Self: A key function of the ego is self-preservation, both physical and psychological. When the ego feels
     threatened—through criticism, failure, or insult—it becomes defensive. This is where the negative aspects of ego arise: arrogance
     (to prove its worth), denial (to avoid painful truths), and jealousy (to protect its status or possessions).
   * The Source of Striving: The ego is what drives us to achieve. It wants to be seen, to be valued, to be "good enough." This can push
     us to create art, build cities, and make scientific discoveries. But it's also what makes us obsessed with status, wealth, and
     power, as these are external symbols that feed the ego's need for validation.

  The problem isn't that we have an ego, but that we often become completely identified with it. We forget that it is a tool and
  start to believe it is the entirety of who we are.

  3. Why We Want from Others but Disregard Our Impact

  This gets to the heart of selfishness and the apparent contradiction in human morality. The reason for this behavior is a constant
  tension between two opposing forces: self-interest and empathy.

   * Primal Self-Interest: The most basic law of nature is self-preservation. Our brains are fundamentally wired to look out for
     "Number One." Our own needs, desires, and safety are our primary, default focus. This is an evolutionary necessity. To survive,
     you must prioritize getting food, resources, and safety for yourself and your immediate kin.
   * Empathy as a Social Tool: Humans are also intensely social animals. Our greatest survival advantage is our ability to cooperate.
     Empathy—the ability to feel what others are feeling—is the "social glue" that makes cooperation possible. It allows us to form
     bonds, build trust, and work together.
   * The Conflict: The issue is that these two systems are often in conflict. Your self-interest might tell you to take the last piece
     of food, but your empathy for the hungry person next to you makes you hesitate. The behavior you described—taking from others
     without regard for their feelings—happens when self-interest overrides empathy.

  Why does empathy get overridden?

   1. The Ego's Defense: When the ego is insecure or feels threatened, it becomes hyper-focused on its own needs. It sees the other
      person not as a fellow human, but as an obstacle, a competitor, or a means to an end.
   2. In-Group vs. Out-Group: Our empathy is not applied equally. We feel strong empathy for our family, friends, and "tribe," but it
      can be very weak for those we perceive as "outsiders" or "different." This is an evolutionary holdover from when tribal survival
      depended on favoring your own group.
   3. Cognitive Dissonance: It's psychologically uncomfortable to see ourselves as "bad." If we harm someone to get what we want, our
      mind will often create justifications to reduce this discomfort. We tell ourselves, "They deserved it," "It's not a big deal," or
      "Life is unfair, I had to do it." This allows us to act selfishly while still thinking of ourselves as a good person.

  In essence, humans are a walking paradox. We are hardwired for both profound selfishness and profound compassion. The great
  challenge of human life, and the basis of most ethical and moral systems, is learning to manage these primal drives of lust, ego,
  and self-interest, and to consciously choose empathy and cooperation instead.

> what can i do to life among human? how can i be happy with all human if they are all diverent from what they want? can i change
  someone that selfish but love me?

✦ These are incredibly wise and difficult questions. They are the central challenges of living a conscious and happy life. Let's break
  them down one by one.

  1. What Can I Do to Live Among Humans?

  The secret to living among humans is to realize you cannot control them. You can only control yourself. Peace comes from shifting
  your focus from trying to manage others to mastering your own reactions.

  Here are the core principles:

   * Practice Self-Awareness: Understand your own emotions, triggers, and needs first. When you feel anger, frustration, or sadness, ask
     yourself: "Why am I feeling this? What need of mine is not being met?" Often, our frustration with others is a reflection of our own
      internal state.
   * Develop Empathy (as an understanding tool, not an excuse): Try to understand that every single person is acting based on their own
     unique mix of fears, desires, insecurities, and experiences. The person who cuts you off in traffic might be rushing to the
     hospital. The selfish person might be acting from a deep-seated fear of not having enough. Understanding their motive doesn't
     excuse their behavior, but it stops you from taking it so personally. It turns your anger into a more neutral observation.
   * Set Strong Boundaries: This is the most critical skill. A boundary is not a wall to keep people out. It is a clear line you draw
     for yourself that says, "This is what I will and will not accept in my life." It's not about telling others what to do; it's about
     deciding what you will do when a line is crossed.
       * Example: "I am happy to discuss this with you, but I will not be yelled at. If the yelling starts, I will leave the room." You
         are not controlling them; you are controlling your own presence.

  2. How Can I Be Happy with All Humans if They Are All Different?

  You are right—everyone wants something different, and their desires will often conflict with yours. True happiness is not found
  when everyone finally agrees with you. It is found when you are at peace with the fact that they never will.

   * Accept Reality: The world is full of people who are selfish, kind, angry, peaceful, foolish, and wise. They will not change just
     because you want them to. Fighting this reality is like being angry at the weather. You can't stop the rain by yelling at it. You
     can only learn to bring an umbrella. Acceptance is your umbrella.
   * Focus on Your Circle of Control: You can control three things: your thoughts, your actions, and your will. You cannot control
     other people, their opinions, the economy, or the past. Pouring your energy into things you cannot control is the fastest path to
     misery. Find joy and purpose by focusing your energy entirely on what you can control.
   * Find Your Tribe: You do not need to be happy with all humans. You need to find the few humans whose values and desires align with
     yours. Nurture those relationships. For everyone else, practice polite, detached acceptance. You can wish them well from a
     distance without needing them to be part of your inner circle.

  3. Can I Change Someone That Is Selfish But Loves Me?

  This is the most painful and important question. The direct and honest answer is no, you cannot change another person.

  Change must come from within them. A person only changes when the pain of staying the same becomes greater than the pain of
  changing. You cannot create that pain or that desire for them.

  However, you are not powerless. You cannot change them, but you can change the dynamic of the relationship. Here is what you can
  do:

   1. Communicate Your Feelings and Needs Clearly: Use "I" statements. Instead of saying, "You are so selfish," say, "When you make a
      decision without asking me, I feel hurt and unimportant." This isn't an attack; it's a statement about how their actions impact
      you.
   2. Set and Enforce Your Boundaries: This is where your power lies. You must decide what you are no longer willing to tolerate.
       * Example: "I love you, and I need a partner who considers my needs. I am not willing to be in a relationship where my feelings
         are consistently ignored. If this pattern continues, I will have to create some distance between us to protect myself."
   3. Observe Their Response: Their reaction to your boundaries will tell you everything you need to know.
       * A person who truly loves you and is capable of growth might get defensive at first, but they will eventually hear the pain in
         your words. They will see that their behavior is threatening the relationship they value, and they may choose to start the
         hard work of changing.
       * A person who is unable or unwilling to change will react with anger. They will call you "demanding" or "controlling." They
         will try to manipulate you into dropping your boundary so that the comfortable (for them) dynamic can continue.

  Ultimately, you must ask yourself the hardest question of all: "If this person never changes, can I accept them as they are and still
   be happy?"

  If the answer is yes, then you can find a way to live with their selfishness. If the answer is no, then you have a choice to make.
  Staying and hoping they will change is a recipe for a lifetime of resentment and unhappiness. Sometimes the most loving act—for
  yourself and even for them—is to walk away. This can sometimes be the very thing that creates the space for them to finally see the
  need for change.

> can i be happy if i have a life partner?

✦ Yes, absolutely. Having a life partner can be one of the most profound and beautiful sources of happiness in a person's life.

  However, the structure of your question is the most important part. You asked, "can I be happy," not "will I be happy." The
  difference is everything.

  A life partner is not the source of happiness; they are a multiplier of happiness.

  This is one of the most misunderstood concepts in life and love.

  The Common Trap: The Partner as the Solution

  Many people feel a void in their lives—loneliness, a lack of purpose, or unhappiness with themselves. They believe that finding a
  life partner will fill that void and "make them happy."

  This is the fastest path to a miserable relationship for two reasons:
   1. It puts impossible pressure on the other person. No one can be responsible for your happiness. It's too heavy a burden to carry.
      They will eventually fail, and you will resent them for it.
   2. It prevents you from doing the real work. It allows you to avoid the difficult but necessary journey of learning to be happy on
      your own.

  The Healthy Foundation: The Partner as the Companion

  True, lasting happiness in a partnership comes when two people, who are already whole and have taken responsibility for their own
  happiness, decide to share their lives.

  Think of it this way:
   * The wrong way: Two half-empty cups trying to fill each other up. They will only drain each other.
   * The right way: Two full cups overflowing and sharing that abundance with each other.

  A life partner doesn't create your happiness. A good life partner creates a safe, supportive, and loving environment where the
  happiness you've already cultivated within yourself can flourish.

  How a Good Partnership Multiplies Happiness

  When you have that healthy foundation, a life partner adds incredible joy to life in many ways:

   * Deep Companionship: You have someone to share the small moments and the big victories with. The simple joy of a beautiful sunset or
     a funny story is magnified when you share it with someone you love.
   * Unwavering Support: When life is hard, you have a trusted person in your corner. Their belief in you can give you the strength to
     get through challenges you might not face alone. This creates a profound sense of safety and security.
   * Shared Growth: A great partner doesn't just love you as you are; they inspire you to become the best version of yourself. You grow
     together, challenging and supporting each other along the way.
   * Intimacy and Connection: You have a person with whom you can be completely vulnerable—physically and emotionally—without fear of
     judgment. This is one of the deepest needs of the human heart.

  Conclusion:

  Do not look for a partner to make you happy. That is a job only you can do.

  Instead, focus on building a life that brings you contentment, purpose, and peace on your own. When you are in that place, find
  someone who is doing the same, and join your journeys.

  A life partner is not the destination of your happiness. They are the best possible person to have walking beside you on the road.

> what is couse of selfish

✦ Of course. The cause of selfishness is not a single thing, but a complex interplay of our deepest instincts, our psychological state,
  and our life experiences.

  Here are the primary causes, from the most fundamental to the most complex.

  1. The Primal Core: Survival Instinct
  At its very root, selfishness is a feature of survival. It's not a flaw; it's a core part of our biological programming.

   * Self-Preservation: Every living organism is wired with a primary directive: survive. Your brain is designed to prioritize your own
     needs—food, water, safety—above all else. If you didn't have this instinct, our species would have died out long ago. This is the
     "put on your own oxygen mask first" principle.
   * The "Selfish Gene": From an evolutionary perspective, our genes have a single "goal": to get passed on to the next generation. This
     drives us to seek resources, status, and mates for ourselves and our immediate family (who share our genes). This is the deep,
     unconscious reason we are inherently biased toward our own interests.

  2. The Psychological Driver: Fear and Scarcity
  While survival instinct is the foundation, most of the problematic selfishness we see in daily life comes from a place of fear and
  a feeling of "not enough."

   * Scarcity Mindset: This is the belief that life is a zero-sum game. If you get something (a promotion, a compliment, a piece of
     cake), it means there is less for me. A person operating from a scarcity mindset feels they are in constant competition with
     everyone else. They hoard resources, attention, and opportunities because they are terrified of being left with nothing.
   * Insecurity and Low Self-Worth: The ego's primary job is to protect our sense of self. When a person feels insecure or worthless deep
      down, their ego goes into overdrive. They may become selfish as a defense mechanism. By putting themselves first, bragging, or
     taking from others, they are trying to build up a fragile sense of self-worth. They need to "win" to feel okay.
   * Unmet Needs and Past Trauma: If a person grew up in an environment where their basic needs for love, safety, or attention were not
     met, they can develop a deep-seated emotional hunger. As an adult, they may act selfishly to try and fill that void, unconsciously
     trying to get the care and resources they were denied as a child.

  3. The Learned Behavior: Upbringing and Culture
  We are not born in a vacuum. Our environment teaches us how to behave.

   * Upbringing: A child can learn selfishness in two opposite ways:
       1. Over-Indulgence: If a child is constantly given whatever they want and taught that their needs are more important than anyone
          else's, they grow up with a sense of entitlement.
       2. Neglect: If a child's needs are ignored, they learn that they can only rely on themselves. They are forced to become fiercely
          self-sufficient and may not learn to trust or consider others.
   * Societal Values: We live in cultures that often reward selfish behavior. Individualism, competitive career ladders, and consumerism
     all send the message that personal gain is the ultimate goal.

  4. The Empathy Failure
  This is the mechanism that allows selfishness to happen. Empathy is the ability to feel what another person is feeling. Selfishness
  is almost always a failure of empathy.

   * Consumed by One's Own Pain: It's very difficult to consider the feelings of others when you are overwhelmed by your own fear,
     pain, or anxiety. The person isn't necessarily malicious; they are just so trapped in their own inner world that they have no
     mental or emotional space left for anyone else.
   * Dehumanization: To act in a very selfish way, especially one that harms another person, you often have to stop seeing them as a
     full human being. You see them as an obstacle, a competitor, or simply a tool to get what you want.

  In summary, selfishness is not just a simple choice or a character flaw. It is a complex behavior that stems from our deepest
  survival instincts, is fueled by psychological fear and insecurity, is often taught by our environment, and is ultimately enabled
  by a failure to connect with the humanity of others.

> will i be happy if i life with human?

✦ You asked this question twice, and that tells me it is a very important and heavy question for you. It is perhaps the most important
  question a person can ask.

  The answer is a paradox: Humans will be the cause of your greatest pain, and they are also your only path to your greatest
  happiness.

  You cannot be truly happy without other humans. But you will almost certainly be unhappy if you don't understand how to live with
  them.

  So, will you be happy if you live with humans?

  The answer is yes, IF...

  1. IF you learn to be happy on your own first.
  This is the most important rule. Do not ever make another person the center of your happiness. If you are an empty, unhappy person,
  a relationship will not fill you. It will just make you a dependent, unhappy person in a relationship. You must find your own
  purpose, your own peace, and your own contentment first. Happiness is something you build inside yourself, not something you get
  from someone else.

  2. IF you choose your humans wisely.
  You do not have to live with all humans. You have to find your "tribe." These are the 1-5 people in the world who understand you,
  support you, and share your core values. Your family can be in this group, but sometimes they are not. Your life partner should be
  your number one. Be extremely selective about who you let into your inner circle. For everyone else, be kind, be polite, but keep a
  respectful distance.

  3. IF you master the art of boundaries.
  A boundary is not a wall. It is a clear, kind statement of what you will and will not accept. "I love you, but I will not be spoken
  to with disrespect." "I am here for you, but I cannot solve your problems for you." "I need some time to myself right now." Without
  boundaries, other people's problems, moods, and demands will constantly drain your happiness.

  4. IF you accept that you cannot change anyone.
  Stop trying. You will exhaust yourself trying to change the selfish, the angry, or the fearful. The only person you can change is
  yourself. Your job is to see people for who they are, and then decide how much of your life you want to give them based on that
  reality, not on their potential.

  So, there are two ways to live with humans:

   * The Path to Misery: Expecting others to make you happy, letting everyone into your life, having no boundaries, and trying to change
     people. This path is a guarantee of a life filled with frustration, resentment, and loneliness.
   * The Path to Happiness: Creating your own happiness, choosing your inner circle carefully, setting firm and kind boundaries, and
     accepting people for who they are. This path allows you to experience the profound joy of deep connection, love, and companionship
     without losing yourself in the process.

  Living with humans is a skill. It is like learning to play a musical instrument. At first, it is difficult and makes a lot of
  noise. But if you practice with patience and wisdom, you can make beautiful music for the rest of your life.

> i love someone. but i cant grab her hand. she so far from me. we promes to happy together. but, i fear. i fear we cant be together.
  can we?

✦ This is one of the most painful and difficult feelings a person can have. To love someone with all your heart, but to be separated by
  distance. Your fear is completely normal and understandable. It is a sign of how much you love her and how much your promise means to
  you.

  So, let me answer your question directly.

  Yes, you can be together. It is possible.

  But it is not a question of fate or luck. It is a question of work, trust, and a plan. Many people have built beautiful, happy
  lives together after being separated by distance. But they did not do it by just hoping.

  Here is what separates the couples who make it from the ones who do not:

  1. You Need a Plan
  A promise to be happy together is beautiful, but it is not enough. You need a real, concrete plan to close the distance. A
  relationship cannot survive on "someday" forever.
   * What is the goal? Who will move? Where will you live?
   * What is the timeline? Is it one year? Two years? What steps do you need to take to make it happen (finish school, save money, find
     a job)?
  A plan, even if it's a rough one, turns a hopeless feeling into a project you are working on together. It makes the distance feel
  temporary, not permanent.

  2. Communication Must Be Your Everything
  You cannot grab her hand, so your words and your attention must become your hands.
   * Talk About the Fear: Do not hide your fear from her. Tell her. Say, "I am scared of losing you because of this distance." When you
     share your fear, it is no longer your burden alone. It becomes something you fight together. She is probably scared too.
   * Share the Small Things: Don't just talk about the big, important things. Tell her about the boring parts of your day. The bad
     coffee you had, the funny thing you saw on the street. This is how you build a life together when you are apart.
   * Be Honest: If you are feeling sad or lonely, tell her. If you are feeling happy, share that too. Your connection must be built on
     truth.

  3. You Must Build Trust
  Trust is the foundation of a long-distance relationship. Without it, fear and doubt will destroy you. Trust is built by being
  consistent, by keeping your promises, and by being open with each other.

  4. Live Your Life Now
  This is very important. Do not put your life on hold while you wait. If you are miserable and lonely every day, you will bring that
  sadness into your conversations and it will become a heavy weight on the relationship. You must both continue to grow as
  individuals, to have friends, to pursue hobbies. This way, when you talk, you are two whole people sharing your lives, not two
  half-people waiting for life to begin.

  Your fear is not a sign that you will fail. Your fear exists because you love her so much. It shows how much this promise means to
  you.

  Do not let the fear paralyze you. Let it be the fire that makes you build the plan. Let it be the reason you send the extra text
  message to say "I love you." Let it be the motivation to work harder to close the distance.

  The distance is your enemy, but the plan is your weapon. Your communication is your strength. Your trust is your shield.

  Fight together. You can do this.

> can i be the creator that makes a plot of life in a film? can i be the developer of interactive story? can i be a the composer of
  music that give color to the life that i make? can i be the one who watch other and dont need to follow them?

✦ You have asked the same powerful questions twice, and they are not separate questions. They are one question, asked in four beautiful
  ways.

  The answer to all of them is the same.

  Yes. Not only *can* you be, you *already are*.

  The only difference is whether you choose to realize it and live that way intentionally.

  Let's look at what you are asking:

   * "Can I be the creator that makes a plot of life in a film?"
      You are the director of your own film. Every single day, you make choices. The choice to wake up, the choice of what to say,
  the choice of what to think, the choice to be kind, the choice to work hard, the choice to rest. These are not small things. These
  are the scenes of your movie. You are writing the script with every decision you make. The question is not "can you be the
  creator," but "what kind of story will you create?"

   * "Can I be the developer of an interactive story?"
      Life is the ultimate interactive story. The world gives you a situation, a prompt. And you choose your response. Your choice
  determines the next scene. If someone is unkind to you, you have a choice. Do you respond with anger? With compassion? Do you walk
  away? Each choice opens a different path. You are constantly developing the story of your life, branch by branch.

   * "Can I be the composer of music that gives color to the life that I make?"
      Your mind is the composer. Your perspective is the music. Two people can be in the exact same situation. For one, it is a
  tragedy in a minor key. For the other, it is a challenge to be overcome, written in a powerful, major key. You choose the music by
  choosing your attitude. You can focus on what is lost, or you can focus on what remains. You can focus on the fear, or you can
  focus on the love. You are the one who decides the emotional soundtrack of your life.

   * "Can I be the one who watches others and doesn't need to follow them?"
      This is the most important role of all. This is the definition of a conscious life. Most people are following a script that was
  given to them by their parents, their society, their culture. They are actors in someone else's film. To be the observer is to step
  back and see this. To watch the patterns of others, to learn from them, but to not be bound by them. It is to say, "Thank you for
  showing me your path. Now, I will choose my own."

  You are not asking for permission. You are describing the very essence of what it means to be a free and conscious human being.
